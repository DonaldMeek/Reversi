Reversi
Reversi is a fun application that lets users play against an artificially intelligent opponent.

How to Play
Reversi uses a command line interface to let users make moves by choosing coordinates. Pieces on the board marked with an X are empty. 
Players can make any move that surrounds the opponent's pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game ends when one player
has no possible moves left, and the winner is the player with the most pieces on the board.

The AI
The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to choose moves. A heuristic function determines which moves have higher 
fitness by counting the number of moves available. Moves in corners of the board are worth 10 times the fitness of other moves.
